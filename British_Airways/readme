Developed a machine learning pipeline for predicting flight booking completion based on customer  data.
Performed data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering (one-hot encoding, feature selection with     Mutual Information).
Scaled data using MinMaxScaler for improved model performance.
Trained and evaluated RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier.
Achieved ~80% accuracy and ~0.66 AUC with both models.
Observed slight variations in performance based on feature selection, with both models showing
comparable results.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
